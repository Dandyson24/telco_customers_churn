# “End-to-End Customer Churn Analysis: From Business Problem to Actionable Retention Strategy”

## Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges for subscription-based and usage-driven businesses. This project presents an end-to-end churn analysis, combining business understanding, exploratory analysis, predictive modelling, and actionable recommendations.

The goal is not just to predict churn, but to understand *why* customers churn and *how* the business can proactively reduce it.

## Business Objective
- Identify customers at high risk of churn
- Understand key behavioural and engagement drivers of churn
- Provide data-driven recommendations for customer retention

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer demographics, subscription details, usage patterns, and engagement signals, along with a binary churn indicator.

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Churn prediction modelling (classification)
- Postdictive analysis (predicted vs actual churn)
- Business recommendations

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest (or specify your model)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision and Recall
- ROC-AUC

## Key Insights
- Churn is strongly associated with tenure, usage intensity, and engagement levels
- Early-tenure and low-engagement customers exhibit higher churn risk
- The model performs well in identifying high-risk churn segments but shows trade-offs between recall and precision

## Business Recommendations
- Prioritise retention efforts on high-risk, high-value customers
- Improve onboarding for early-tenure customers
- Design targeted engagement campaigns for low-usage users

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
